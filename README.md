# SIO2 Pack Generator :package:

This project is a proof of concept for an
introductory course on how to prepare a package for
SIO2 system. Step by step, user creates their own
task statement in an on-line editor, creates sample
test and correctness tests. Program then prepares
a simple package, ready for deployment in SIO2 system.

This project aims to be a tool for teachers and students
and serve an educational purpose. It's **not necessary**
to have any programming knowledge to create a package.

### Supported package features:
 * Task statement in HTML
 * Sample & Correctness IO tests
 * Custom tag and title

### Future possible improvements:
 * Task statement in PDF
